# Combining-Predictive-Techniques
This project provides recommendation to a grocery store chain planning a significant expansion. It involves the use of multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on where and how to expand. 
The project showcases how predictive techniques can be used to solve complex business problems
Alteryx and Tableau are the two maain tool/software used in the project.

Task 1: Determining Store Format
This includes determine the optimal number of store formats based on sales data, using a K-means clustering model to segment the 85 current stores into the different store formats.

Task 2: Determine the Store Format for New Stores
This includes developing a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store; using a 20% validation sample with Random Seed = 3 when creating samples with which to compare the accuracy of the models. Make sure to compare a decision tree, forest, and boosted model; using the model to predict the best store format for each of the 10 new stores.
   
Task 3: Forecasting Produce Sales
This includes forecasting produce sales for existing stores you should aggregate produce sales across all stores by month and create a forecast; forecasting produce sales for new stores: summing the forecasts of the existing and new stores together for the total produce sales forecast.
